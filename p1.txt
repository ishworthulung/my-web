Nice to meet you, and thank you for visiting my page!  

My official name is Ishwor Rai, but my parents originally gave me the name Sachin. However, after grade 3, I decided to change my name because I liked "Ishwor" betterâ€”interesting, right?  

I was born on October 16, 2002, in Kathmandu but my home village is Solukhumbu. I completed my SEE and SLC from Shree Mahendra Boudha. Although IT and web design were not part of my academic studies, as I pursued humanities in grades 11 and 12, I had a strong interest in Computer Science. Unfortunately, my math results weren't great, which led me to choose humanities instead. ðŸ˜”  

Despite this, my passions have always been in web design, robotics, and electronics. Driven by curiosity, I started learning on my own from various sources. During this time, I also completed mobile repair training and learned video editing.  

As I developed my skills, I began uploading videos on YouTube related to my projects. My efforts paid off when BreadElectronic.me offered me a four-month internship after watching my work. After completing my internship, I resumed uploading videos, and two months later, I was hired by IHR Nepal.  

At IHR Nepal, I worked on robotics and electronic projects, and eventually, I started teaching robotics as a STEAM teacher.  

Currently, I am still working at IHR Nepal. Teaching is a challenging yet rewarding job, but my passion lies in creating projects across different domains, including coding, robotics, and electronics. I continue sharing my work on my YouTube channel to inspire others.
