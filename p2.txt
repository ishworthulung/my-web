Every person has a moment that sparks their curiosity.
For me, that moment came from a friend.

One day, he showed me a tiny motor from his toy car, powered by a battery. I was amazed. Was this really possible? How did it work? My mind was full of questions. I asked if I could have it, but he said, "Rs. 20."
I had no money. After a long negotiation, I got it for Rs. 10. Sadly, that money was meant to buy salt, and when my mother found out, she slapped me. ðŸ˜¢
Still, I was hooked. I experimented with the motor attaching cardboard, trying to drill into walls and soil. Eventually, it stopped spinning. I guessed the battery had died, and after testing, I realized I was right.
