A few days later, I saw my friend again, this time lighting up LEDs. Once again, I was fascinated. How was he doing it? He offered to sell me some LEDs, but I refused to use my mother’s money. Instead, I had another plan my father sent me to buy a razor blade, and I used that money instead. Of course, I got in trouble when he found out.
Still, I couldn’t stop. I connected the LED to a battery and saw that more voltage made it glow brighter. That’s when I learned about voltage.
Then, I had an idea: "If more voltage makes the LED brighter, what if I plug it into the electrical socket?"
I connected the LED to an AC plug, stepped back, and turned the switch. Guess what happened?
ofcourse it glowed ohh sorry, Ofcourse it blowed i mean exploded.
And the whole room went dark.
