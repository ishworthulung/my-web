The journey that sparked my passion for electronics was a pivotal moment. From that point on, I developed an insatiable hunger to learn more and more about the field. During those early days, I had limited resources, so I scavenged components from old electronic devices some even from children's shoes! Yes, certain kids' shoes have built in LEDs that light up when they step on the ground, and I repurposed them for my projects.

After completing SEE, I finally had some money. I used it to purchase electronic components online, fueling my learning journey and diving deeper into robotics. As I explored the world of electronics and robotics, I discovered their connection to web design and app development, which ignited yet another interest in me.

This is my "Big Bang" story in short form. I hope you enjoyed it!
